# TODO
in the SaveInfo class, when the user inputs gender it tests to see if "m" exists in the text, then sees if "f" exists in case "m" is not found. "Female" contains an "male" and thus "m", therefore it will always assume the gender is male. This can be solved by checking first if "f" exists in the string, then "m".
